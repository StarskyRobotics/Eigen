# Eigen
A port of the Eigen linear algebra library for Arduino

This is a port of Eigen 3.3.2. This is a very early version of this library and should be considered "in development". It has undergone limited testing on a Teensy 3.6 device.
**Eigen is a C++ template library for linear algebra: matrices, vectors, numerical solvers, and related algorithms.**

To install, simply clone or download this library into your Arduino/libraries folder.
